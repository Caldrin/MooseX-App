A list of TODO tasks if you are interested in improving MooseX::App 

* Better support for Hashref attrs (Difficulty:Medium)
    * optionally use colons (or any other character) instead of equal signs 
      as key-value separators
    * allow to specify multiple pairs in one attribute. ie. instead of
      --hash key=value --hash anotherkey=anothervalue
      allow the following syntax
      --hash key=value anotherkey=anothervalue

    * ie. "mycommand.pl some command" would translate to 
      "MyCommand::Some::Command"

      should return a list of available subcommands for "some")
