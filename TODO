A list of TODO tasks if you are interested in improving MooseX::App 

* Better support for Hashref attrs (Difficulty:Medium)
    * optionally use colons (or any other character) instead of equal signs 
      as key-value separators
    * allow to specify multiple pairs in one attribute. ie. instead of
      --hash key=value --hash anotherkey=anothervalue
      allow the following syntax
      --hash key=value anotherkey=anothervalue 
      also see permute
* Nested subcommands (Difficulty:Medium-Hard)
    * ie. "mycommand.pl some command" would translate to 
      "MyCommand::Some::Command"
    * How to distinguish between subcommands and positional params?
    * Make sure that help handles subcomands (ie. "mycommand.pl some help"
      should return a list of available subcommands for "some")
    * Make sure that the typo plugin handles subcommands
* Better positional param detection (Difficulty:Medium)
* Better error messages on unrecognized params (Difficulty:Medium)
    * Improve "Did you mean ..." suggestions
    * Suggestions if attribute was suplied with only one leading dash
* Handle type constraint unions (Difficulty:Easy) 
    * generating description for attributes
* Allow alternative param/attribute syntax (Difficulty:Easy-Medium)
* I18N (Difficulty:Hard)
    * Based on current user locale
    * Register languages
    * Register strings (ie by plugins)
    * How to handle PODs?
    * Language fallbacks
    * Allow to specify command documentation in multiple languages
* Documentation
    * General improvements
    * Extend tutorials
    * Clarify and highlight MooseX::App::Simple
* Optional bundling of params (Difficulty:Medium)
   * currently -bac translates to '-b -a -c'
   * Optionally turn this behaviour off
* Getopt::Long compatibility (Difficulty:Medium)
   * coordinates=f{2} - Accept multiple values per key
   * library=s@ - Accept empty options
   * ! - Negation 
   * + - Increment
* Virtual attributes (Difficulty:Medium)
   * Handled via callbacks
* Permute (Difficulty:Medium)
   * see Getopt::Long permute
   * "--attr val1 --attr val2" vs. "--attr val1 val2"
